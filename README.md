## Share Paint draw together
Share Paint can be used to paint together. Each participant draws his part on the display of his device, and the joint picture is displayed on the screen.
Drawing together often helps to learn more about each other, about each other's views on life or on individual events in life.
Two people draw how they see a particular situation, and their combined vision is displayed on the phone screen.
The Share Paint app can also be used just for fun, drawing funny pictures together.
